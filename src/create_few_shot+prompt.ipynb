      "The chapter narrates a refugee patient presenting with 2 days of high fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea and mucosal bleeding. Vital signs showed hypotension (90/60 mmHg) and fever 39.6 °C. During an ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak, she was placed in an isolation ward. Lab testing was suspended initially for biosafety; later, point-of-care ELISA antigen and PCR from a specialized field lab confirmed Ebola virus infection while IgG remained negative, indicating acute disease. Despite intravenous fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and analgesics, her condition worsened rapidly: subconjunctival haemorrhage, profuse oral/nasal/rectal bleeding, dyspnoea, pulse 150 bpm, respiratory rate 36/min, hypothermic shock (36 °C), coma, and death within 24 h of admission. The text emphasises that haemorrhage is absent in some HF cases, that differential diagnoses include complicated malaria, typhoid, leptospirosis, and bacterial gastroenteritis, and that strict viral HF precautions plus contact tracing are mandatory. It also summarises filoviral pathophysiology (capillary leak, DIC) and cites WHO IPC guidance. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}\n",

      "The chapter describes a 7-year-old Peruvian girl with a 4-month painless ulcer on her nose that started as a papule after travel to an Andean valley. Physical exam showed a 2 cm indurated ulcer with plaque-like infiltration; no lymph nodes, no fever. Differential diagnoses listed include cutaneous leishmaniasis, sporotrichosis, cutaneous tuberculosis, and Balamuthia infection. The text notes that cutaneous leishmaniasis is common in Andean valleys and typically produces painless ulcers with raised borders. Work-up recommendations: scrape under ulcer edge for Giemsa smear (70 % sensitivity), culture or PCR for Leishmania species, leishmanin skin test, and additional tests for sporotrichosis or mycobacteria if leishmaniasis is excluded. In the case, smear was negative, leishmanin skin test positive, PCR confirmed Leishmania (Viannia) peruviana. Treatment given: IV sodium stibogluconate 20 mg/kg/day × 20 days plus topical imiquimod; good epithelialisation by day 20 and scar formation without relapse at 3 months. The chapter also reviews treatment-failure risk factors (young age, short stay in endemic area, multiple lesions, Viannia complex species) and systemic therapy options when topical therapy is inadequate. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}\n",

      "The case describes a comatose 4-year-old Ugandan girl during the rainy season. She had headache, chills, an early-morning seizure, and persistent coma. Vital signs: T 38.7 °C, HR 150 bpm, BP 98/40 mmHg. Blantyre Coma Score 1/5; no neck stiffness; hepatosplenomegaly. Malaria RDT positive; haematocrit 17.6 %, platelets 28 × 10⁹/L. Differential diagnoses highlighted: cerebral malaria, acute bacterial meningitis, viral encephalitis, organophosphate intoxication, metabolic derangements, non-convulsive status epilepticus. WHO definition of cerebral malaria (“otherwise unexplained coma with parasitaemia”) is noted to be non-specific because asymptomatic parasitaemia is common. Authors emphasise lumbar puncture to exclude meningitis, ophthalmoscopy for malarial retinopathy (retinal whitening, haemorrhages, orange vessels) to support cerebral malaria, and EEG to exclude non-convulsive seizures. Case continuation: CSF clear/acellular; normal opening pressure; ophthalmoscopy showed white-centred haemorrhages → diagnosis retinopathy-positive cerebral malaria; treated with IV artesunate, intensive monitoring; recovered consciousness by 40 h and discharged day 5 with neurology follow-up. Mortality of cerebral malaria 15–25 %, one-third survivors with neuro-sequelae. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}\n",

      "The chapter describes a chronically under-nourished, unimmunised four-year-old Lao boy who developed a foul-smelling sore on his cheek that, within three days, destroyed portions of the upper and lower lip and right cheek, leaving teeth exposed. The lesion is characterised as gangrenous and rapidly progressive. The authors state that the clinical picture is typical of noma (cancrum oris), an opportunistic infection in children aged 1–7 years whose immunity is compromised by malnutrition and antecedent infections such as measles or malaria. Differential diagnoses considered include dental abscess with cellulitis, oral cancer, syphilis, yaws, cutaneous or mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, all deemed unlikely given the child’s age and the lesion’s fulminant course. Recommended immediate therapy is high-dose penicillin plus metronidazole to cover synergistic aerobic and anaerobic oral flora, aggressive nutritional rehabilitation with liquefied high-protein foods, evaluation for co-morbid infections (malaria, helminths, tuberculosis, vitamin deficiencies), debridement of necrotic tissue, physiotherapy to prevent contractures, and delayed reconstructive surgery (> 1 year) by specialists. Untreated noma has a 70–90 % fatality rate; early antibiotics and nutrition markedly improve survival. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}\n",
