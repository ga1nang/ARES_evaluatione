Using money from a tax refund, together with a loan from Eastman's uncle, the young artists self-published a single-issue comic intended to parody four of the most popular comics of the early 1980s: Marvel Comics’ ""Daredevil"" and ""New Mutants"", Dave Sim’s ""Cerebus"", and Frank Miller’s ""Ronin"". The ""TMNT"" comic book series has been published in various incarnations by various comic book companies since 1984."	Giovanni Ribisi		0.0	0.0
