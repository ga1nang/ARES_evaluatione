I have only dyed my hair once. nothing permanent a rinse really. WOuld you dye your hair yes I have but the reason was  to cover my white  hair I love seeing silvery white hair. My kids laugh at me because I have two strands and I brush my hair to make sure they show. LOL. What color did you use? I used black because my hair used to be all black but now it's all white and im barely 45 years old. My hairdresser does  a good job of coloring it for me once every 2 months  Ok. What do you think about using colors like purple or pink, which are not natural hair colors?	Hair coloring, or hair dyeing, is the practice of changing the hair color. The main reasons for this are cosmetic: to cover gray or white hair, to change to a color regarded as more fashionable or desirable, or to restore the original hair color after it has been discolored by hairdressing processes or sun bleaching. 	I prefer that is dyed black because it's more professional for me because of my line of work. if i was a musician or private business owner I would have gone with purple	[[Yes]]	[[Yes]]	[[Yes]]
I know it's kind of weird...but I like to take cold showers :) You need to take advantage of the indoor structure of showers so I say do what you want! Once you get used to them, they are actually quite nice for waking you up. A bit..shocking I dare sya I agree! You know there are early signs of Egyptians having indoor shower rooms where servants would bathe them? I did not know that, but I'm not surprised. I'm not sure when the first person got that bright idea, but it was probably far, far back	The original showers were neither indoor structures nor man-made but were common natural formations: waterfalls. The falling water rinsed the bathers completely clean and was more efficient than bathing in a traditional basin, which required manual transport of both fresh and waste water. Ancient people began to reproduce these natural phenomena by pouring jugs of water, often very cold, over themselves after washing. There has been evidence of early upper class Egyptian and Mesopotamians having indoor shower rooms where servants would bathe them in the privacy of their own homes. However, these were rudimentary by modern standards, having rudimentary drainage systems and water was carried, not pumped, into the room. The ancient Greeks were the first people to have showers. Their aqueducts and sewage systems made of lead pipes allowed water to be pumped both into and out of large communal shower rooms used by elites and common citizens alike. These rooms have been discovered at the site of the city Pergamum and can also be found represented in pottery of the era. The depictions are very similar to modern locker room showers, and even included bars to hang up clothing. The ancient Romans also followed this convention; their famous bathhouses (Thermae) can be found all around the Mediterranean and as far out as modern-day England. The Romans not only had these showers but also believed in bathing multiple times a week, if not every day. The water and sewage systems developed by the Greeks and Romans broke down and fell out of use after the fall of the Roman Empire. 	Well actually it just started with someone pouring a jug of water, which was often very cold. You would have liked that!	[[Yes]]	[[Yes]]	[[Yes]]
I would like to be a physician because  the profession is concerned with promoting, maintaining, or restoring health through the study, diagnosis, and treatment of disease and others  Nice ,so what does it take to be one?	"A physician, medical practitioner, medical doctor, or simply doctor, is a professional who practises medicine, which is concerned with promoting, maintaining, or restoring health through the study, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of disease, injury, and other physical and mental impairments. Physicians may focus their practice on certain disease categories, types of patients, and methods of treatment—known as specialities—or they may assume responsibility for the provision of continuing and comprehensive medical care to individuals, families, and communities—known as general practice. Medical practice properly requires both a detailed knowledge of the academic disciplines, such as anatomy and physiology, underlying diseases and their treatment—the ""science"" of medicine—and also a decent competence in its applied practice—the art or ""craft"" of medicine.
