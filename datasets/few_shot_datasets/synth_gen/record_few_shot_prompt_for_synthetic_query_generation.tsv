By 23 April 2013, Alon was selling tickets at three times face value and more, and told @placeholder this by email.	FIFA president Sepp Blatter’s No 2 Jerome Valcke has been suspended as general secretary pending an investigation into allegations - first revealed by Sportsmail - that he was central to a ticket touting operation at the 2014 World Cup. Such an agreement would breach FIFA's ticketing rules as well as represent a conflict of interest. It is understood that Valcke will contest the claims.

The die-offs are common in @placeholder, where rivers, lakes and even the ocean are blighted by raw sewage and garbage.	Tons of rotting fish have filled a lagoon in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil where Olympic rowing and canoeing events will be held during next year's Games. Over the past week, thousands of the silver fish have died and have been scooped out of Rodrigo de Freitas lake, but city authorities and biologists have argued about the cause. More than 37 tons of fish have been collected, according to Rio's waste management company, but there is still an overwhelming stench, sparking complaints from neighbours and passers-by.

The third try came just a minute into the second half as @placeholder beat a marginal offside call to collect a pass from skipper Fourie du Preez for the 13th World Cup try of his career.	Bryan Habana equalled Jonah Lomu's World Cup try-scoring record as he led South Africa into the quarter-finals with a crushing victory over the United States at the Olympic Stadium. Former All Black Lomu stood three tries clear of Habana on 15  heading into the match but the winger ran over a hat-trick against a much-changed USA side as the Springboks recorded a convincing 64-0 victory to top Pool B and set up a meeting with either Wales or Australia in the last eight. But Habana did miss a glorious opportunity to break the record as he knocked on unchallenged in the in-goal area. @highlight South Africa wing Bryan Habana scored three tries to take his tally to 15 in Rugby World Cup history @highlight Francois Louw scored twice as the Springboks ran in 10 tries during their Pool B clash at the Olympic Stadium @highlight Victory sees the two-time World Cup winners through to the quarter-finals of this year's tournament	Bryan Habana	Lebron	[[Yes]]	[[Yes]]	[[Yes]]
