The M104 155mm Projectile was specifically designed to carry about 11.7 pounds of what prototypical substance?	"The M104 155mm Projectile was a chemical artillery shell designed for use by the U.S. Army. It was specifically designed to carry about 11.7 pounds of sulfur mustard H or HD blister gas.  The M104 155mm Projectile was a chemical artillery shell designed for use by the U.S. Army. It was specifically designed to carry about 11.7 pounds of sulfur mustard H or HD blister gas.  Sulfur mustard, commonly known as mustard gas, is the prototypical substance of the sulfur-based family of cytotoxic and vesicant chemical warfare agents, which can form large blisters on exposed skin and in the lungs. They have a long history of use as a blister-agent in warfare and, along with organoarsenic compounds such as Lewisite, are the most well-studied of such agents. Related chemical compounds with similar chemical structure and similar properties form a class of compounds known collectively as sulfur mustards or mustard agents. Pure sulfur mustards are colorless, viscous liquids at room temperature. When used in impure form, such as warfare agents, they are usually yellow-brown and have an odor resembling mustard plants, garlic, or horseradish, hence the name. The common name of ""mustard gas"" is considered inaccurate because the sulfur mustard is not actually vaporized, but dispersed as a fine mist of liquid droplets. Sulfur mustard was originally assigned the name LOST, after the scientists Wilhelm Lommel and Wilhelm Steinkopf, who developed a method of large-scale production for the Imperial German Army in 1916.

Which filmmaker, Stan Brakhage or Alfred L. Werker, was a non-narrative filmmaker?	"where formula_56 is the usual ""Newtonian"" potential satisfying Poisson's equation formula_57, just like Eq(3.a) or Eq(4.a) for the Weyl metric potential formula_2. The similarities between formula_2 and formula_56 inspire people to find out the ""Newtonian analogue"" of formula_2 when studying Weyl class of solutions; that is, to reproduce formula_2 nonrelativistically by certain type of Newtonian sources. The Newtonian analogue of formula_2 proves quite helpful in specifying particular Weyl-type solutions and extending existing Weyl-type solutions. "	James Stanley Brakhage	[[No]]	[[No]]	[[No]]
