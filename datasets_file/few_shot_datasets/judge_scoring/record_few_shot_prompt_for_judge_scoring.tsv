The doctors at GOSH have argued that every medical option has already been considered and treatment in another country would not be in @placeholder's best interest.	"(CNN) The London hospital where baby Charlie Gard is being treated for a rare genetic disorder has been receiving death threats. ""The GOSH community has been subjected to a shocking and disgraceful tide of hostility and disturbance,"" Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) Chairman Mary MacLeod said in a statement released Saturday. The terminally ill infant is at the center of an international legal controversy over whether the hospital should support experimental efforts to extend his life. ""Staff have received abuse both in the street and online,"" the statement continued. ""Thousands of abusive messages have been sent to doctors and nurses whose life's work is to care for sick children. Many of these messages are menacing, including death threats. Families have been harassed and discomforted while visiting their children, and we have received complaints of unacceptable behavior even within the hospital itself. @highlight Hospital chairman says staff, patients and patients' families have endured abuse @highlight A trial involving Charlie's case is set to begin Tuesday at the UK High Court"	Charlie Gard	[[Yes]]	[[Yes]]	[[Yes]]
I have infinite gratitude to the spirit of the @placeholder people, of our firefighters, our soldiers, our policemen and all workers who haven't slept, haven't eaten as they work hard to save lives, he said after arriving.	"(CNN) Rescue crews searched desperately through rubble for survivors of a magnitude-7.8 earthquake that struck coastal Ecuador. The death toll has soared to 272, Ecuador's President Rafael Correa said Sunday evening. That number is expected to rise as rescue teams dig through the rubble, he said. Earlier that day, Vice President Jorge Glas had estimated that at least 2,527 people were injured. The hardest-hit area was the coastal Manabi Province, where about 200 people died, said Ricardo Peñaherrera of Ecuador's national emergency management office.

Having said she considers @placeholder unfit to be president, she should not be among those who rule upon the outcome of the election, he said.	Hillary Clinton hinted at a 2016 presidential run during a star-studded gala on Tuesday, asking an enthusiastic audience of female Democrats: 'Don't you someday want to see a woman president?' However, the former US first lady shunned questions about her 'extensive' use of a personal email address during her four-year tenure as Secretary of State from January 2009 to February 2013. She also avoided claims that she violated the US Federal Records Act by failing to preserve her correspondence via hdr22@clintonemail.com on State Department servers until two months ago. Instead, Mrs Clinton teased the audience about her political future during the 30th anniversary gala of EMILY's List, an organization that works to elect Democratic women who support abortion rights. @highlight Hillary Clinton hinted at a 2016 presidential run during EMILY'S List event @highlight She spoke of having the opportunity to 'make millions of decisions' in life @highlight Then asked female audience: 'Don't you want to see a woman president?' @highlight As the crowd erupted, Mrs Clinton spoke of women's economic security @highlight However, she avoided questions about her use of personal email account @highlight Also steered clear of claims that she violated the US Federal Records Act @highlight Mrs Clinton took selfie with Orange Is The New Black actress Uzo Aduba @highlight Other speakers included star America Ferrera and  chef Padma Lakshmi	Donald Trump	[[Yes]]	[[Yes]]	[[Yes]]
The war between the group and @placeholder government has left an estimated 220,000 dead.	Havana, Cuba (CNN) Negotiators seeking to end the five-decades-old bloody insurgency in Colombia said Wednesday they had reached a final peace deal in one of the world's longest-running conflicts. For nearly four years, representatives from the Colombian government and the FARC rebel group have struggled to reach a deal that would not only end the fighting but also address issues of land reform, curtailment of the drug trade, repatriation of victims' families and trials for those suspected of human rights abuses. A majority of Colombians must still approve the landmark deal in a referendum set for October 2. Provisions that allow FARC leaders who confess their crimes to avoid prison may make the deal a bitter pill to swallow for many Colombians who think the rebels are escaping justice for decades of murder, kidnapping and drug trafficking. @highlight Colombian rebels have been fighting the government for more than 50 years @highlight Landmark deal still faces approval in a referendum set for October 2	Landmark	[[Yes]]	[[No]]	[[No]]
For inventive staff looking to follow in the footsteps of @placeholder, however, losing out on a fortune could soon be a thing of the past.	She is the mastermind behind the BBC's most successful entertainment show ever. But Fenia Vardanis, 52, has revealed her reward was a bottle of champagne and some chocolates while Strictly Come Dancing went on to become more commercially successful than Top Gear. In contrast, the motoring show's former presenter Jeremy Clarkson and producer Andy Wilman were paid millions by the BBC for revamping the format to attract an international audience. Though not bitter about missing out on millions of pounds in royalties, Vardanis said she got only £4,000 for dreaming up her idea - the staff bonus she 'would probably have got anyway'. @highlight Fenia Vardanis, 52, was mastermind behind Strictly Come Dancing show @highlight But she revealed she received just champagne and chocolates as reward @highlight Meanwhile Top Gear producer and presenter Jeremy Clarkson paid millions @highlight BBC is now drawing up proposals for creative staff to receive royalties	George Washington	[[Yes]]	[[No]]	[[No]]
'So to play in front of a packed crowd at @placeholder is pretty special and I'm definitely looking forward to playing the pink-ball test.'	Part of Jerusalem is seeing its worst flare-up in years. Here's a look at some of the key questions about the fighting. What started this new wave of violence? The violence certainly had not gone away, with rocket attacks from Gaza and Israeli military incursions in the West Bank regular occurrences. But last month's abduction of three Israeli teens who were on their way home from school in the West Bank brought the tensions to a fever pitch. Israelis waited with bated breath, hoping for word that they were alive. When the bodies of Eyal Yifrach, Gilad Shaar and Naftali Frankel -- a dual Israeli-American citizen -- were found on June 30, the country was grief-stricken. The Israeli government blamed Hamas, which denied responsibility but praised the abductions. Israel carried out arrests and demolished homes of the suspects in the West Bank, and launched airstrikes against targets in Gaza that are used to lob rockets into Israel. Palestinians stepped up rocket attacks and clashed with Israeli troops. @highlight The killings of three Israeli teens sparked national grief @highlight The killing of a Palestinian teen sparked grief and clashes in a usually quiet area @highlight Israel announced a confession in the killing of another Israeli teen @highlight An American teen visiting Palestinian relatives was beaten	water	[[No]]	[[No]]	[[No]]
Host Jake Tapper countered @placeholder and said he has heard the president praise police officers.	"Calais, France (CNN) Tensions are high inside ""The Jungle,"" a sprawling makeshift refugee camp in the French port town of Calais, where authorities are to begin evicting migrants Monday. Authorities have given the thousands of people living there two options: seek asylum in France or return to their country of origin. Some 6,900 refugees, more than 1,200 of them children, live in the encampment, a jumble of squalid tents and temporary shelters. Clashes between migrants and police erupted Saturday night at the camp, said Sue Jex, head of operations for the charity Care 4 Calais. She said a number of buildings inside the camp were destroyed by fire. @highlight ""The Jungle,"" a makeshift camp for refugees and migrants, to be torn down by end of year @highlight Thousands of residents will be evicted and offered the chance to apply for asylum in France @highlight More than 1,000 riot police officers have been deployed"	Balls	[[No]]	[[No]]	[[No]]
